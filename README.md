## Mazhar Mansoor

I work at the intersection of **thinking, systems, and intelligence**.

I design frameworks, write playbooks, and build simple artifacts that help humans think clearly and act deliberately inside complex systems — especially those shaped by AI.

### Current Focus
- 🧠 Prompt engineering as a *design discipline*, not a bag of tricks  
- 🧩 Mental models for strategy, ethics, and decision-making  
- ✍️ Writing playbooks, essays, and structured thinking tools  

### Selected Work
- 📘 **Prompt Engineering Playbook**  
  A teaching-first, systems-oriented guide to prompt engineering

- 🧠 **Working Intelligence**  
  Essays and frameworks on clarity, cognition, and human judgment  
  → https://mazmansoor.github.io/Working-Intelligence/

- ♟️ **Win the Game** *(book)*  
  A framework for clarity, strategy, and long-term advantage in a noisy world

### How I Think
- Prompts are **interfaces**, not tricks  
- Clarity compounds  
- Structure beats cleverness  
- Ethics matter more as systems scale  

### Background
- Program Manager in public infrastructure & long-term planning  
- Business and ethics educator  
- Writer focused on AI, leadership, and human judgment  

### Collaboration
I’m open to:
- Thoughtful collaborations  
- Teaching or curriculum design  
- Writing or research at the edge of AI, strategy, and society
