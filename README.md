Mazhar Mansoor  
Architect of intelligence. Builder of modern systems.

I design and deploy AI-first platforms, learning systems, and decision frameworks that operate under real-world constraints—where clarity, reliability, and governance matter as much as technical capability.

My work is grounded in a simple principle:  
**intelligence only matters when it can survive scale, complexity, and consequence.**

## What I Do

I build systems at the intersection of:

- **AI-first architecture** — prompt-driven systems, agentic workflows, human-in-the-loop design  
- **Systems thinking** — feedback loops, failure modes, long time horizons  
- **Human judgment & ethics** — legible, governable, aligned intelligence  

I do not chase models or trends.  
I design enduring architectures for thinking, learning, and decision-making.

## Core Repositories (Foundational Work)

These repositories form the backbone of how I think and build.

🧠 **Intelligence Lab**  
A long-term research and design space for understanding intelligent systems before they are built.  
Focuses on problem framing, constraints, system design, evaluation, and postmortems.  
→ https://github.com/Mazmansoor/intelligence-lab

🏗️ **AI App Template**  
A reusable execution template for building AI-powered applications with agents, prompts, evals, and infrastructure.  
Designed to enforce discipline: docs before code, evals before scale.  
→ https://github.com/Mazmansoor/ai-app-template

## How I Build

- I design systems, not demos  
- I treat prompts as interfaces, not tricks  
- I prioritize clarity, failure awareness, and scale  
- I assume systems will be used by real people, in imperfect conditions  
- I design with ethical and institutional consequences in mind

## Professional Foundation

- Program Manager in public infrastructure and long-term capacity planning  
- Business and ethics educator  
- Writer and practitioner focused on AI, leadership, and human judgment  

---

## Collaboration

I’m interested in collaborating with individuals and organizations who are:

- Building AI-first products with real-world impact  
- Designing systems that must operate at scale and under constraint  
- Thinking seriously about governance, ethics, and long-term consequences
