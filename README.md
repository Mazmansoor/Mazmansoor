## Mazhar Mansoor

I work at the intersection of **thinking, systems, and intelligence**.

I design frameworks, write playbooks, and build simple artifacts that help humans work more clearly with complex systems — especially AI.

### Current Focus
- 🧠 Prompt engineering as a *design discipline*
- 🧩 Mental models for strategy, ethics, and decision-making
- ✍️ Writing: playbooks, essays, and structured thinking tools

### Selected Work
- 📘 **Prompt Engineering Playbook**  
  A teaching-first, systems-oriented guide to prompt engineering

    → https://github.com/Mazmansoor/Working-Intelligence/  
    
- ♟️ *Chess, strategy, and clarity under pressure*  
  (Writing in progress)

### How I Think
- Prompts are **interfaces**, not tricks  
- Clarity compounds  
- Structure beats cleverness  
- Ethics matter more when systems scale  

### Background
- Program Manager (public infrastructure & planning)
- Business & ethics educator
- Writer focused on AI, leadership, and human judgment

### Collaboration
I’m open to:
- Thoughtful collaborations
- Teaching or curriculum design
- Writing or research at the edge of AI & society
